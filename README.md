# Decentralized Identity Management

## Project Description

The Decentralized Identity Management system is a blockchain-based solution that empowers individuals to own, control, and manage their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities. Built on Solidity smart contracts and deployed on Core Testnet 2, this system provides a secure, transparent, and user-controlled approach to identity verification and credential management.

This platform allows users to create their decentralized identities, add various credentials (educational, professional, certifications), and have these credentials verified by authorized entities. The system ensures data privacy, prevents identity theft, and provides immutable proof of credentials while giving users complete control over their personal information.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a world where individuals have complete sovereignty over their digital identities. We aim to eliminate the dependency on centralized identity providers, reduce identity fraud, and create a trustless system where credentials can be verified instantly without compromising user privacy.

**Key Principles:**
- **Self-Sovereignty**: Users own and control their identity data
- **Privacy-First**: Minimal data exposure with maximum verification capability
- **Interoperability**: Compatible across different platforms and services
- **Transparency**: All verification processes are recorded on blockchain
- **Accessibility**: Easy-to-use interface for both technical and non-technical users

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **🆔 Identity Creation**: Users can create their decentralized identity with basic information
- **📜 Credential Management**: Add, store, and manage various types of credentials securely
- **✅ Verification System**: Authorized verifiers can validate and approve credentials

### Advanced Features
- **🔐 Multi-layered Security**: Role-based access control with authorized verifiers
- **📊 Transparent Verification**: All verification requests and approvals are recorded on-chain
- **🔄 Flexible Credential Types**: Support for education, employment, certifications, and custom credential types
- **🎯 Request-Response System**: Structured workflow for credential verification requests
- **👥 Verifier Management**: Contract owner can authorize and revoke verifier permissions

### Technical Features

   cd decentralized-identity-management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your private key and other configurations
   ```

4. **Compile Contracts**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

5. **Deploy to Core Testnet 2**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here

- **RPC URL**: https://rpc.test2.btcs.network
- **Chain ID**: 1115
- **Explorer**: https://scan.test2.btcs.network

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Identity
```javascript
await contract.createIdentity("John Doe", "john@example.com");
```

### Adding Credentials
```javascript
await contract.addCredential("education", "0x123...credentialHash");
```

### Requesting Verification
```javascript
const requestId = await contract.requestVerification("education", "0x123...credentialHash");
```

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions
1. **createIdentity(name, email)** - Create a new decentralized identity
2. **addCredential(credentialType, credentialHash)** - Add credentials to identity
3. **verifyCredential(identityOwner, credentialType, isApproved, requestId)** - Verify credentials

### Utility Functions
